# GopherScript
## CoffeeScript inspired language that compiles to Go

> NOTE: This is a learning project and should only be looked at by those wanting to laugh at terrible Scheme code

To compile, [install Chicken Scheme](https://www.call-cc.org/) and revel in it.
Seriously, Chicken Scheme is fantastic.

A lot has been borrowed (cough cough) from the Monkey language from the fantastic book "Writing An Interpreter In Go" by Thorsten Ball https://interpreterbook.com/

Most of the parser, transformer and code generator were inspired by The Super Tiny Compiler https://github.com/thejameskyle/the-super-tiny-compiler

Also a lot has been gleaned from http://beautifulracket.com/, which I thoroughly recommend as well.

The language itself will be dynamically typed (against my better judgement) and will hopefully have a more functional lean Ã  la Scheme.

Painless Go interop is also going to be a major goal.
